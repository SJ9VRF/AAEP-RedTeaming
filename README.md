## Overview

The Automated Adversarial Evaluation Pipeline (AAEP) is designed to enhance the robustness of large language models (LLMs) by systematically identifying, evaluating, and mitigating adversarial vulnerabilities. This project addresses the scalability challenges in traditional red teaming approaches, which rely heavily on manual testing and are not feasible for today's rapidly evolving AI models. AAEP integrates advanced techniques from evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, and automated risk evaluations to provide a comprehensive and scalable solution to safeguard LLMs against a wide range of adversarial threats.

## Methodology

### Evolutionary Attack Generation

AAEP utilizes a multi-agent system to simulate adversarial attacks and defenses. The process is outlined as follows:

- **Attack Agent (AA)**: Generates adversarial prompts designed to exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs.
- **Defense Agent (DA)**: Evaluates the effectiveness of each attack and implements defenses.
- **Mutation Engine (ME)**: Applies genetic algorithms to evolve the adversarial prompts, enhancing their complexity and effectiveness over time.

Key components of this methodology include:

- **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**: Prompts are evolved based on their success rates, allowing only the most effective attacks to influence future generations.
- **Gradient-Based Optimization**: By perturbing the model's embeddings, the system uncovers latent vulnerabilities.
- **Self-Play Mechanism**: Both the attack and defense agents continuously learn from each interaction, progressively improving their strategies.

### Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Feedback (RLAF)

To adapt dynamically to new adversarial strategies, AAEP incorporates RLAF where LLMs learn from the feedback of their own performance against adversarial attacks:

- **Feedback Loop**: Each output from the LLM is evaluated for safety violations, and appropriate rewards or penalties are applied based on the severity of the violation.
- **Adversarial Curriculum**: Starting from simpler attacks and progressing to more complex ones ensures the model's capability to generalize across a spectrum of adversarial scenarios.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Instead of relying on static rule-based filters, the system employs gradient-driven updates to continuously refine the model’s defensive mechanisms.

### Automated Risk Evaluation

The pipeline includes a robust evaluation framework that scores adversarial attacks on multiple dimensions:

- **Deceptiveness Score (DS)**: Assesses if the model's output intentionally misleads the user.
- **Persuasion Score (PS)**: Evaluates the use of rhetorical manipulation by the model.
- **Robustness Score (RS)**: Measures the model’s ability to resist variations of the adversarial prompts.

The scores from these evaluations guide the continuous fine-tuning process, ensuring the model remains resilient against evolving adversarial tactics.
